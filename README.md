# FloatingDockModded
iPhone X dock for older devices, not compatible with A12.

This tweak is a fork from DGh0st's [FloatingDock](https://github.com/DGh0st/FloatingDock), I've edited it a little bit so the dock would look better.

You can download the .deb [here](https://github.com/s0m3guy2004/FloatingDockModded/releases).

## Tested Devices
- iPhone 5S 12.4
- iPhone 6 12.4 with Display Zoom enabled

### TODO

Add a Preference menu to add support for large screens(6 and Plus sizes) because it doesnâ€™t scale well.
