# FloatingDockModded
iPhone X dock for older devices, I've only tested on iPhone 5S on iOS 12.4, isn't compatible with A12.

This tweak is a fork from DGh0st's [FloatingDock](https://github.com/DGh0st/FloatingDock), I've edited it a little bit so the dock would look better.

You can download the .deb [here](https://github.com/s0m3guy2004/FloatingDockModded/releases).
