# FloatingDock odded
iPhone X dock for older devices, slightly edited by me to change some visuals. Only tested on iPhone 5S on iOS 12.4

This tweak is a fork from DGh0st's [FloatingDock](https://github.com/DGh0st/FloatingDock).

You can download the .deb [here](https://github.com/s0m3guy2004/FloatingDock-Modded/releases).
